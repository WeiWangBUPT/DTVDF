# DTVDF
	We implement a decentralized trapdoor verifiable delay function DTVDF based on Wesolowski’s VDF scheme 
 	(EUROCRYPT'2019). It is a function f: X → Y that can resist parallel computing while allowing for easy
	and quick verification of calculation results. The rapid computation of DTVDF results relies on the
 	collaboration of multiple participants. 
 # Four algorithms of DTVDF
  
We implement KShareGen, YShareGen, YShareVer, and Combine four algorithms.
